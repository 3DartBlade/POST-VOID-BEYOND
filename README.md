IMPORTANT: This is not the game itself, you still need to have it to be able to play!

Changes:
- The knife now insta-kills everything
- The shotgun reloads a bit faster (Some might find this uneccesary, but I thought it would make the shotgun a more worthy weapon)
- "Serious mode" upgrade now makes you run faster in all directions
- "Ghost" upgrade gives you NO slowdown when you touch enemies (great combo with serious mode and knife!)
- Implemented cut upgrade called "Wide eyes" which increases your FOV (originally it would have been a one-time upgrade, but I made it stackable)
- Implemented cut upgrade called "Corridors only" which likely removes the big rooms, so you don't get disoriented that easy (I am unsure if it actually does that)
- Increased number of possible upgrades from 3 to 5
- I made sure you don not get the same upgrade choices twice (Yes, I needed do it myself, it wasn't impleneted originally)
- Changed the epilepsy warning (just for fun, but please be aware that this game can easily trigger an epileptic seizure!)
- At the start of each level it now shows the act, AND the level you are on, making it easier to keep track of what level you are on (i.e.: first level "[Act 1]", second level "[Act 1 - Level 2]", fourth level "[Act 2]", fifth level "[Act 2 - Level 2]" etc.)



How to play:
- Download the "data.win" file
- Locate the game's folder
- Make a BACKUP of the original "data.win" file if you want to play the original version again!
- Move the downloaded "data.win" file to the game's folder (Agree to overwriting the old file if you have already made a backup)
- Start the game

Alternatively:
- Download the "data.win" file
- Locate the game's folder
- Rename the data.win file to anything you would like, keeping the .win extention (e.g.: beyond.win)
- Add the argument "-game ./Renamed.win" to the game on Steam (how-to:https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/28392/how-to-add-a-command-line-argument-to-a-steam-game) or create a shortcut to the game and add the argument at the end of that (how-to: https://www.digitalcitizen.life/shortcut-arguments-parameters-windows/)
- Launch the game either from Steam, or with the new shortcut

(Using shortcuts like this allows you to quickly and easily launch either version)
